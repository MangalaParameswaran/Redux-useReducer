⭐ EASY WAY TO REMEMBER
| If your state is                      | Use               |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Simple & used in 2–3 components       | **useContext**    |
| Complex but inside one component      | **useReducer**    |
| Shared across whole app, API, caching | **Redux Toolkit** |

🧠 🔥 FINAL CLEAR DIFFERENCE (VERY IMPORTANT)
🔸 useContext
➡ Only shares state
➡ Does NOT manage complicated state
➡ Good for small apps

🔸 useReducer
➡ Manages complex logic inside a component
➡ Does NOT solve global state

🔸 Redux Toolkit
➡ Best global state solution
➡ Solves everything: loading, API, caching, error, store, slices
➡ Used in real-world professional apps
